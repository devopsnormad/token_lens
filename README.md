# TokenLens

**TokenLens** is a powerful tool built with Next.js and subgraph technology to monitor and analyze transactions for four popular tokens: USDT, BNB, TRON, and SHIB. This project visualizes transaction data in a user-friendly interface with interactive cards and detailed views.

## Features

- **Token Cards**: Displays transaction totals of the current date for each token (USDT, BNB, TRON, SHIB) on individual cards.
- **Transaction Details**: Click on a token card to view a detailed list of transactions for that token.
- **Detailed View**: Click on a specific transaction to see its detailed information.
- **Bar Chart Visualization**: A dynamic bar chart shows the daily total transactions for each token, providing a clear comparison.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **Subgraph**: Used to pull transaction data from the blockchain, enabling real-time data updates and querying.
